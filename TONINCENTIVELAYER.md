# Incentive Layer on TON: Perfect Solution Between Commerce and Privacy

## Dilemma of Privacy Invading Business Model

The most successful Web2 companies believe that "data is the new oil", and have taken the notion to the extreme. These companies invest massive resources in constructing highly efficient data collection and monetization systems.

In this commercial setup, internet companies almost focus only on two goals: making every effort to understand every user behavior, and using **recommendation algorithms** to match users with _products_ and _services_ they are likely to pay for. By consistently pursuing these two goals, internet companies have successfully monetized users' data, and it is as lucrative as selling oil.

However, the seeking of these objectives through consistently squeezing user data has raised significant concerns:

- Continuous data exploitation often fails to protect privacy.

- Overusing recommendation algorithms to match revenue-generating services and products, this occupies attention from users' _real demands_.

Users start to become worried about their privacy being used frivolously, becoming extremely insecure. Users found out that these apps often fail to directly meet their needs, instead bombarding them with an endless stream of "recommended" and supposedly "essential" content. In a word: users are not happy.

## Why 900 Million Choose Telegram and TON

Meanwhile, we have witnessed a commercial miracle: Telegram's monthly active users have surpassed 900 million, almost in a way that differs from commercial goals pursuing companies.

Privacy protection is considered one of the most important reasons people choose Telegram for daily communications. Users enjoy this elegant and efficient interaction, as if we have found what the internet should be like.

Commerce has its own natural logic, and many entrepreneurs want to meet users' commercial needs on Telegram. The partnership between Telegram and TON allows us to see the possibility of an elegant win-win solution between commerce and privacy.

While the topology of Telegram and TON is:

  Businesses -> Users

  Businesses -> Businesses

  Users -> Users
</p>


We are building a privacy-protecting commercial topology based on TON: The Incentive Layer.

- Users have full control over their data
- Business and user needs can be well-matched
- Business, users, and TON can achieve a win-win situation

## Incentive Layer

The two core features of the Incentive Layer are **Incentive Passport** and **WISE Score**.

**Incentive Passport** is a user profile bridging on-chain and off-chain identities. Projects can track users' on-chain footprints through Incentive Passport to determine whether they are a good target to incentivize.

**WISE Score** is an index that quantifies user impact and allows users to freely choose whether to erase their traces. WISE Score refers to the user's scores in four dimensions: **Wealth**, **Identity**, **Social**, and **Engagement**. Users actively verify their data through **Attestation** to build their impact, submitting and aggregating it into the Incentive Passport as proof of their impact in the community. 

The user data used in WISE Score is data that users actively open up. Users can revoke any data they wish to erase at any time, which is a data sovereignty friendly design.

## Leaderboard for Demands Matching 

By ranking WISE Scores, the **WISE Score Leaderboard** can help businesses find the most suitable user crowds.

We are designing an **interactive**, **data-erasable** and **competitive** WISE Score Leaderboard. The Leaderboard is a _**new paradigm**_ for **demand matching** that can help projects find their most core community supporters. Leveraging the Leaderboard, projects can design fairer and more effective incentive methods to build their communities and businesses.

Through different dimensions of the Leaderboard, projects can find the most suitable users for their projects. This matching model can maximize the efficiency of cold boost of a project, while allowing users to profit in the TON ecosystem without compromising their privacy.

Leveraging the leaderboard aggregated by one or more dimensions, combined with the user's contribution to the project, a project can _**design a perfect airdrop scheme in the TON ecosystem**_. We believe that the TON WISE Score Leaderboard will _**greatly improve**_ the efficiency of new projects onboarding the TON ecosystem and _**promote the applications explosion**_ in the TON ecosystem.

TBook hopes to help TON become the perfect choice for all entrepreneurs who wish to make a difference in the Web3 world.
