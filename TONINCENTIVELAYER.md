# Incentive Layer on TON: Perfect Solution Between Commerce and Privacy

## Dilemma of Privacy Invading Business Model

The most successful Web2 companies believe that "data is the new oil", and have taken the notion to the extreme. These companies invest massive resources in constructing highly efficient data collection and monetization systems.

In this commercial setup, internet companies almost focus only on two goals: making every effort to understand every user behavior, and using **recommendation algorithms** to match users with _products_ and _services_ they are likely to pay for. By consistently pursuing these two goals, internet companies have successfully monetized users' data, and it is as lucrative as selling oil.

However, the seeking of these objectives through consistently squeezing user data has raised significant concerns:

- Continuous data exploitation often fails to protect privacy.

- Overusing recommendation algorithms to match revenue-generating services and products, this occupies attention from users' _real demands_.

Users start to become worried about their privacy being used frivolously, becoming extremely insecure. Users discover that internet apps often fail to directly meet their needs, instead bombarding them with an endless stream of "recommended" and supposedly "essential" content. In a word: users are not happy.

## Why 900 Million Choose Telegram and TON

Meanwhile, we have witnessed a commercial miracle: Telegram's monthly active users have surpassed 900 million, almost in a way that does not pursue any commercial goals.

Protection of privacy is considered one of the most important reasons people choose Telegram for daily communications. Users enjoy this elegant and efficient interaction. When we use Telegram, it's as if we have found what the internet should be like.

Commerce is a naturally occurring logic, and many entrepreneurs want to meet users' commercial needs based on Telegram. The partnership between Telegram and TON allows us to see the possibility of an elegant win-win solution between business and privacy.

## TON Incentive Layer: Win Win Solution

The topology of Web2 model is:

While the topology of Telegram and TON is:

We are building a privacy-protecting commercial topology based on TON: The Incentive Layer.

- Users have full control over their data
- Business and user needs can be well-matched
- Business, users, and TON can achieve a win-win situation

## Incentive Layer

The two core features of the Incentive Layer are **WISE Score** and **Incentive Passport**.

**Incentive Passport** is an on-chain user profile. In the TBook Incentive Layer, users can build and manage their identity using incentive passports. Incentive Passport is not just an on-chain user profile; projects can track users' on-chain footprints through Incentive Passport to determine whether they are a good target of an airdrop.

**WISE Score** is an index that quantifies user impact and allows users to freely choose whether to erase their traces. WISE Score refers to the user's scores in four dimensions: **Wealth**, **Identity**, **Social**, and **Engagement**. In the Incentive Layer, users actively verify their data through on-chain Attestation to build their influence, submitting and aggregating it into the Incentive Passport as proof of their influence in the community. By ranking WISE Scores, the WISE Score Leaderboard can help businesses find the most suitable user crowds.

The user data used in WISE Score is data that users actively open. Users can revoke any data they wish to erase at any time, which is a design that respects user data sovereignty.

## Leaderboard as Demands Matching Mechanism

We are designing an interactive, data-erasable competitive WISE Score Leaderboard. The Leaderboard is a new paradigm for demand matching that can help projects find their most core community supporters. Based on the Leaderboard, projects can design fairer and more effective incentive methods to build their communities and businesses.

By combining data from different dimensions, projects can find the most suitable initial core user group for their projects on the Leaderboard. This matching model can maximize the cold boost cost of a project in its early stages of operation while allowing users to profit in the Web3 ecosystem without compromising their privacy.

According to the leaderboard aggregated by one or more dimensions, combined with the user's contribution to the project, a project can design a perfect airdrop scheme in the TON ecosystem. We believe that the TON WISE Score Leaderboard will greatly improve the efficiency of new projects onboarding the TON ecosystem and promote the explosion of applications in the TON ecosystem.

TBook hopes to help TON become the perfect choice for all entrepreneurs who wish to make a difference in the Web3 world.
