# Incentive Layer on TON: Perfect Solution Between Commerce and Privacy

## Dilemma of Privacy Invading Business Model

The most successful Web2 internet companies are also the most successful data companies. They have taken the value proposition of "data is oil" to the extreme. Internet companies invest vast resources in constructing a highly efficient data monetization business system.

In this business system, internet companies almost exclusively focus on two goals: making every effort to understand every user behavior and using recommendation algorithms to match users with products and services they are likely to pay for. By consistently fulfilling these two goals, internet companies have indeed achieved their business objectives, much like selling oil, although they are not merely selling resources.

However, there are some notable problems with achieving business goals by constantly extracting user data:

- Continuous data exploitation often fails to protect privacy.

- Overusing recommendation algorithms to match revenue-generating services and products squeezes out users' _real demands_.

Users start to become anxious about their privacy being used arbitrarily, becoming extremely insecure. Users find that opening an internet app does not efficiently meet their needs but rather immerses them in more and more "recommended" and "considered necessary" content. In a word: users are unhappy.

## Why 900 Million Choose Telegram and TON

Meanwhile, we have witnessed a business miracle: Telegram's monthly active users have surpassed 900 million, almost in a way that does not pursue commercial goals.

Protection of privacy is considered one of the most important reasons people choose Telegram for daily communications. Users enjoy this elegant and efficient interaction. When we use Telegram, it's as if we have found what the internet should look like.

Business is a naturally occurring logic, and many entrepreneurs want to meet users' commercial needs based on Telegram. The collaboration between Telegram and TON allows us to see the possibility of an elegant win-win solution between business and privacy.

## TON Incentive Layer: Win Win Solution

The topology of Web2 model is:

Business -> Platform -> Users

While the topology of Telegram and TON is:

Business -> Users

Business -> Business

Users -> Users

We are building a privacy-protecting commercial topology based on TON, namely the Incentive Layer.

- Users have control over their data
- Business and user needs can be well-matched
- Business, users, and TON achieve a win-win situation

## Incentive Layer

The two core products of the Incentive Layer are WISE Score and Incentive Passport.

Incentive Passport is a user-owned profile on the blockchain. In the TBook Incentive Layer, users can build and manage their online identity by creating and managing their passport. Incentive Passport is not just an on-chain user profile; projects can track users' on-chain behavior footprints through Incentive Passport to determine whether they are worthy of an airdrop.

WISE Score is an index that quantifies user impact and allows users to freely choose whether to erase their traces. WISE Score refers to the user's scores in four dimensions: Wealth, Identity, Social, and Engagement. In the Incentive Layer, users actively verify their data through on-chain Attestation to build their influence, submitting and aggregating it into the Incentive Passport as proof of their influence in the community. By ranking WISE Scores, the WISE Score Leaderboard can help businesses find the most suitable user groups.

The user data used in WISE Score is data that users actively open. Users can revoke any data they wish to erase at any time, which is a design that respects user data sovereignty.

## Leaderboard as Demands Matching Mechanism

We are designing an interactive, data-erasable competitive WISE Score Leaderboard. The Leaderboard is a new paradigm for demand matching that can help projects find their most core community supporters. Based on the Leaderboard, projects can design fairer and more effective incentive methods to build their communities and businesses.

By combining data from different dimensions, projects can find the most suitable initial core user group for their projects on the Leaderboard. This matching model can maximize the cold start cost of a project in its early stages of operation while allowing users to profit in the Web3 ecosystem without compromising their privacy.

According to the leaderboard aggregated by one or more dimensions, combined with the user's contribution to the project, a project can design a perfect airdrop scheme in the TON ecosystem. We believe that the TON WISE Score Leaderboard will greatly improve the efficiency of new projects onboarding the TON ecosystem and promote the explosion of applications in the TON ecosystem.

TBook hopes to help TON become the perfect choice for all entrepreneurs who want to make a difference in the Web3 world.
