# Value of Sybil Attack Resistant Policies

## What is Sybil Attack

In the crypto world, a Sybil attack occurs when malicious actors and speculators create multiple fake identities or accounts to manipulate a system for more benefits. This is particularly problematic in Web3, where speculators may use technical means to create numerous fake users and unfairly claim a larger share of tokens during airdrops or distribution events, undermining the fairness and integrity of the system.

## Why is it Crucial to Prevent Sybil Attacks

When a Web3 project conducts an airdrop, the goal is often to incentivize two types of users:

1. Users who have participated in and contributed to the project in the past
2. Users who can continuously bring more value to the project in the future

Airdrops are crucial for projects, and if a project fails to target and incentivize the right users crowd as described above, the airdrop budget may be taken by useless or malicious addresses or participants. The consequences of such a scenario can be catastrophic and intangible for the project.

## TBook Sybil Attack Policy

1. TBook Incentive Passport uses a multi-dimensional identity aggregation approach, increasing the cost of conducting Sybil attacks.
2. For the same task, each social identity can only participate once. This renders the repetitive work of Sybil attackers ineffective.
3. WISE Score's multi-dimensional data aggregation, combined with big data analysis, further filters out Sybil attack addresses.

TBook has already collaborated with some top Web3 projects to develop airdrop plans and execute airdrop campaigns. Over one million users have registered for the TBook Incentive Passport. In addition to optimizing overall airdrop efficiency and maximizing capital efficiency, TBook has also accumulated many practical Sybil attack-resistant methods and policies, which have been integrated into the TBook Incentive Passport.
