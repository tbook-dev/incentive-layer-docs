**What is the WISE Score?**

**W**ealth, **I**dentity, **S**ocial, **E**ngagement. The WISE Score is a multidimensional, holistic way to measure a user's influence and value in the TBook community. It considers not only a user's on-chain wealth but also their identity, social connections, and community engagement.

## Benefits of WISE Score

1. **A Comprehensive Metric**: WISE Score provides a more comprehensive and balanced assessment of a user's community value by considering multiple dimensions, not just wealth.

2. **Incentivizing Engagement**: By including engagement as a key factor, WISE Score encourages active participation and contribution to the TBook community.

3. **Fostering Social Connections**: The social dimension of WISE Score promotes networking and relationship building within the community.

4. **Verifiable and Trustworthy**: WISE Score leverages on-chain data and verifiable credentials, ensuring the scores are transparent and resistant to manipulation.

## Understanding the Dimensions

### 1. Wealth (W)

The wealth dimension considers a user's on-chain assets, including cryptocurrency holdings, NFTs, and other digital assets. This dimension provides insight into a user's financial stake in the community.

### 2. Identity (I)

The identity dimension takes into account a user's verified credentials, such as KYC, social media profiles, and other forms of identity verification. A higher identity score indicates a more trustworthy and authentic user.

### 3. Social (S)

The social dimension measures a user's connections and interactions within the TBook community. This includes factors such as the number of followers, the quality of interactions, and the user's overall social influence.

### 4. Engagement (E)

The engagement dimension assesses a user's level of activity and contribution to the TBook community. This includes actions such as posting content, participating in discussions, and engaging with other users' content.

## Calculating the WISE Score

The WISE Score is calculated using a proprietary algorithm that assigns weights to each dimension based on their relative importance. The exact formula is not disclosed to prevent gaming of the system.

## Accessing Your WISE Score

Users can view their WISE Score on their TBook profile page. The score is updated in real-time based on the user's activity and interactions within the community.

## Future Developments

The TBook team is continuously working on refining and expanding the WISE Score system. Future updates may include additional dimensions, more granular scoring, and integration with other TBook features.
