## What is the WISE Score?

## Summary

The WISE Score serves as an impartial and measurable benchmark for assessing the holistic contribution and value of accounts, both within the Web3 ecosystem and beyond. Through meticulous examination of user behaviors, the WISE Score assigns a numerical rating to each holder of a TBook incentive passport.

Unlike simplistic metrics that merely tally interaction volumes and values with smart contracts, protocols, and dApps, the WISE Score’s evaluation framework is more nuanced. It scrutinizes the extent and depth of a user’s involvement in Web3 incentive campaigns, their steadfast loyalty, as well as any unique identity roles and credentials they possess.
